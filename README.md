ðŸ“Š Cluster Cryptos by Behavior

**Project Overview**
This project aims to analyze and group cryptocurrencies based on their historical price behavior using clustering techniques. The objective is to discover hidden structure in the crypto market and provide insights into how different coins behave relative to one another over time.

By clustering coins based on key performance metrics like volatility, return, and correlation with Bitcoin, we aim to identify behavioral groupings such as high-volatility coins, stable performers, or Bitcoin-following coins. These insights may help investors, analysts, and developers better understand market dynamics, segment the market, or design targeted investment strategies.

**Business Motivation**
The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, diversity, and lack of structure compared to traditional financial markets. Thousands of coins exist, but their behavior and investment risk profiles differ drastically.

Why this matters:

Investors often struggle to choose from a vast array of cryptos beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Exchanges, funds, and portfolio managers can benefit from behavioral segmentation to create diversified portfolios.

Developers and researchers can use such clustering to study altcoin trends and market anomalies.

Clustering cryptos by historical behavior allows for:

Identifying hidden relationships between coins.

Understanding altcoin dependencies on Bitcoin movements.

Spotting potential outliers or unique market movers.

**Dataset**
We use the All Crypto Currencies dataset from Kaggle, provided by JesseVent.

Dataset Highlights:

Daily market data for thousands of cryptocurrencies from April 28, 2013 to November 2021.

Features include: open, high, low, close, volume, market_cap, and rank per coin per day.

~1,600 unique coins across ~620,000 records.

Initial preprocessing will include:

Filtering coins with sufficient data length (e.g., at least 180 days of trading).

Handling missing values and low-volume/noisy coins.

Aggregating per-coin behavioral metrics (see below).

**Proposed Features for Clustering**
We plan to engineer a feature vector per coin based on:

Average daily return

Return volatility (standard deviation)

Max drawdown

Volume trend

Correlation with Bitcoin (or Ethereum)

Sharpe ratio or risk-adjusted return

These will allow grouping based on volatility, performance, stability, and Bitcoin dependency.

**Methods & Tools**
Data Wrangling: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

Feature Engineering: log returns, rolling volatility, correlation matrices

Clustering Techniques: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN (comparison-based)

Dimensionality Reduction: PCA or t-SNE for visualization

Exploration Platform: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Optional Dashboard: Streamlit or Dash (time permitting)

**Risks and Unknowns**
Data Sparsity & Inconsistency
Many altcoins are inactive, short-lived, or sparsely traded. Filtering appropriate coins will be essential.

Time-Dependency of Features
Behavior can change over time. We'll explore using fixed windows (e.g., past 6 months) vs. full-history aggregates.

Feature Scale & Selection Sensitivity
Clustering may be highly sensitive to how we scale and normalize different features. Feature selection will require careful experimentation.

Labeling & Validation
Unsupervised learning lacks ground truth. We will rely on cluster interpretability and qualitative assessment.
